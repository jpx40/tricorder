## Introduction

[Ansible](https://ansible.com) is a great tool for automation. But it suffers
from the same problem of many such tools: a big pile of custom YAML DSL.

YAML is used to provide a declarative syntax of your automated workflow. This is
nice for simple use cases, but automation can become rather complex very
quickly.

But once those tools start implementing:

 - control flow structures (conditions, loops)
 - variable assignations
 - modules
 - package management
 - ...

Your YAML files become a programming language with terrible developer
experience.

**tricorder** aims to fix this. It gives you a single tool to perform tasks on
multiple remotes. You then use your common UNIX tools like `bash`, `jq`, `curl`,
etc... to compose those tasks together.

## Usage

Just like *Ansible*, **tricorder** uses an inventory file, listing the hosts
to connect to:

```toml
[[hosts]]

id = "backend"
tags = ["server", "backend", "myapp"]
address = "10.0.1.10:22"
user = "admin"

[[hosts]]

id = "frontend"
tags = ["server", "frontend", "myapp"]
address = "10.0.1.20:22"
user = "admin"
```

> **NB:** The inventory is either a TOML file or an executable producing a JSON
> output. This way you can create dynamic inventories by querying a remote
> service or database.

Then, run one of the following commands:

```
$ tricorder -i /path/to/inventory do -- echo "run on all hosts"
$ tricorder -i /path/to/inventory -H backend do -- echo "run on specific host"
$ tricorder -i /path/to/inventory -t "server & myapp" do -- echo "run on all hosts matching tags"
```

Or to run concurrently instead of sequencially:

```
$ tricorder -i /path/to/inventory do -p -- echo "run on all hosts"
$ tricorder -i /path/to/inventory -H backend do -p -- echo "run on specific host"
$ tricorder -i /path/to/inventory -t "server & myapp" do -p -- echo "run on all hosts matching tags"
```

> **NB:** Authentication is done via `ssh-agent` only.

Every logging messages is written on `stderr`, the command result for each host
is written as a JSON document on `stdout`:

```json
[
  {
    "host": "backend",
    "success": false,
    "error": "..."
  },
  {
    "host": "frontend",
    "success": true,
    "info": {
      "exit_code": 0,
      "stdout": "...",
      "stderr": "...",
    }
  }
]
```

This way, you can compose this tool with `jq` to extract the relevant informations
in your scripts.

## Usage with the Rust API

**tricorder** is also available as a Rust crate to include it directly in your
software:

```rust
use tricorder::prelude::*;
use tricorder::tasks::exec;
use serde_json::json;

let inventory = Inventory::new()
  .add_host(
    Host::new(Host::id("localhost").unwrap(), "localhost:22".to_string())
      .set_user("root".to_string())
      .add_tag(Host::tag("local").unwrap())
      .set_var("msg".to_string(), json!("hello"))
      .to_owned()
  )
  .to_owned();

let task = exec::Task::new("echo \"{host.id} says {host.vars.msg}\"".to_string());

// Run the task sequentially:
let result = inventory.hosts.run_task_seq(&task).unwrap();
// Run the task concurrently:
let result = inventory.hosts.run_task_parallel(&task).unwrap();

println!("{}", result);
```
